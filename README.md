## Project Description

This project is my midterm contribution for the DataTalks.Club [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code), that I am participating in in autumn 2022.

It is based on [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset) on diabetes factors, which can be downloaded directly from the page.

The project has two main components: 1. predicting targets for unknown samples via machine learning and 2. model deployment.

    1. Machine Learning: data preprocessing and predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on some features like the BMI, age or concentration of glucosis in their blood sample
    2. Model Deployment with Flask while managing dependencies with virtual environments and Docker

## Data and Problem to Solve

The data was collected by the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Using the dataset for a classification task can help to detect diabetes patients, that haven't been diagnosed yet, based on an ensemble of diagnostic measurements, that each doctor can easily obtain. (Of cause, this is only a study project, and nothing will come from it, but let's just pretend here.)
